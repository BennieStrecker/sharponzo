# Sharponzo
Right now, just a dummy project accessing the Monzo API, might grow into something more.

## TODO
- Remove the faff from default MVC views
- Add back in DateTime extensions for Start/End of week and Weeks of a Month.
- __Unit tests!__
- __A Front-End!__
- __Exception/Error Handling!__
- General Refactoring (/salute)
    - Filter, Calculator (rename)
    - List MonzoTypes into their relating Type
    - MonzoApi and Authorisation into one Project (both depend on RestSharp and perform requests)
    - Remove the test code in HomeController>Callback in favour of unit tests
    - Change Callback to a Monzo Dashboard (?) View
    - Make the Filter more generic (?)
- Look into GraphQL
